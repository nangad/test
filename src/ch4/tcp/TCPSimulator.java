/**
 * The <b>main class</b> of a simple simulator for TCP congestion
 * control.
 * The simulated network consists of the network elements of sender-host,
 * router, and receiver-host, connected in a chain as follows:
 * <P><CENTER>
 * <code> SENDER <-> ROUTER <-> RECEIVER </code>
 * </CENTER>
 * <P>The sender host sends only data segments and the receiver host
 * only replies with acknowledgements.  In other works, we assume
 * <i>unidirectional transmission</i>, for the sake of simplicity.
 * <P>
 * By default, the simulator reports the values of the congestion
 * control parameters for every iteration:<BR>
 * <ol>
 * <li> Iteration number, starting with zero</li>
 * <li> Congestion window size in this iteration</li>
 * <li> Effective window size in this iteration</li>
 * <li> Flight size (the number of outstanding bytes) in this iteration</li>
 * <li> Slow start threshold size in this iteration</li>
 * </ol>
 * At the end of the simulation, the <i>utilization of the sender</i>
 * is reported.
 * <P>
 * You can turn ON or OFF different levels of reporting by setting
 * the variable {@link int #currentReportingLevel}.
 * <P>
 * Obviously, there are almost no parameters that can be controlled
 * on this "simulator".  The reason is that its main purpose is to
 * serve as a <i>reference example</i> for students to build their
 * own simple simulators, rather than to have a flexible, multi-functional
 * network simulator.
