/**
 * This class is a simple simulation of a network router.
 * Expressly crafted to "route" TCP packets.  What it does it to
 * enforce that no more packets are let pass through than what the
 * <i>bottleneck resource capacity</i> allows.
 * <P>
 * The bottleneck resource that we study using this router is the
 * buffer space, which determines the maximum possible queue length
 * (the queue capacity).
 * If more packets arrive than the queue (buffer) can hold, the excess
 * packets are discarded.
 * <P>
 * <b>Notice:</b> It is assumed that this router drops only the
 * data segments, if they arrive in excess of the capacity.
 * There is <i>no limit</i> acknowledgement segments, so
 * acknowledgement segments are <i>never</i> discarded.<BR>
 * In fact, if you check the <code>TCPSimulator</code> code, method
 * <code>run()</code>, the router is not even invoked for the
 * acknowledgement segments.  Of course, this is only for the sake
 * of simplicity, and in the real world all packets are subjected
 * to the same treatment at the network level.
